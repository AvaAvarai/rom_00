# rom_00

A prototyping workspace for testing and working with SDL2 within the native C99 programming language.

## Building

- `make` -- Builds a windows executable
- `make clean` -- Removes the built executable

## Todo

- Replace makefile flags with the sdl2-config bash script to uncouple from Windows dependency.
- PROTOTYPE! TEST! and LEARN!
